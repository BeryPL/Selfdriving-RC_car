# Selfdriving-RC_car
Code for a self-driving and RC-controlled car via bluetooth.

Self-driving and RC-controlled car made using NXP FRDMKL05Z and Arduino Nano development board for a subject at university. 
Car can be controlled from Arduino via bluetooth or from the same Arduino control board it can be put into self-driving mode.
In this mode the car uses ultrasound sensor mounted on a servo motor to navigate.

Not all files are posted, because some of the used libraries are part of subject laboratory and I am not allowed to share them.
